Configuration
-----------------

To use apport to send bug reports, please set your email address
and a smtp server in your /etc/default/apport configuration file.

If you do not know a smtp server, leave it to the default.



Usage
---------

Please be conscious when filing bug reports with apport. Ensure that
it is a bug and not a faulty user error behavior
