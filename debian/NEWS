apport (2.14.2-3) experimental; urgency=medium
  
  apport-notifyd notification daemon does not have the ability to
  shutdown by itself. Thus if you logout of your desktop session and
  log back in, you will have more than 1 instances of the daemon
  .
  This will result in multiple apport popups when a crash occurs
  .
  To overcome this problem, please ensure that you only have one
  instance of apport-notifyd running. For example, on KDE systems, you
  can create a shell script under ~/.kde/shutdown to
  `pkill apport-notifyd` during logout
  .
  The support to have only 1 invocation per user will be added in a
  later release
